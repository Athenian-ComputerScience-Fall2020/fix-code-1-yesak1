# Fix the code #1

## Problem Description
This is a simple calculator that computes multiples of 3. The user enters a number and the calculator returns three times that number.

Unfortunately, there is an issue with the code. Run it and see what happens. Does it run? If so, is the answer what you expect? 

## Example (what *should* happen)
```
Value entered: 5
15
```

## Hints
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
